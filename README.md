# NullnVoid 2.0
## Fallout Terminal Styling Hacking Game

### Inspiration
- All of us have grown up playing video games and this website and game is a homage to one of our favorites, Fallout.
1. What was the biggest challenge you faced as a team with this project?
- Trying to package our original project in java and javaFX to run inside an applet inside a web browser.
- Making the switch from our original language with java and javaFX, to a more robust and better integrated javaScript to help run our game on our website.
2. History and Future
- We originally developed this program in JavFX, but had issues packaging and running it as a standalone program. So, we decided to translate the project from JavaFX to JavaScript, and we were able to do it in less than 3 weeks. Now, our website and game are integrated and we are working on getting a standalone version of our game up for download. We are also looking into setting up a leaderboard either thru MongoDB or phpMyAdmin. This is something that we will develop if time permits before our release deadline of April 16th, 2019.

## We hope you enjoy our game, and please share it with your friends, and let us know of any updates you would like to see in the future!!!
